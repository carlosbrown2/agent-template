# Extracted into a sourceable library so the regex anchors, policy matrix,
# retry-state transitions, and prereq-id extractor can be exercised by
# tests/hooks/ralph.bats without running the main agent loop. ralph.sh
# sources this at runtime; the bats suite sources it at test time. The
# "one implementation, one library" pattern (CLAUDE.md § Discovered
# Patterns) — production and tests both load these definitions from a
# single file, so drift between callers is not possible.

# Extract confidence level from agent output.
# Patterns require the closing `>` so the placeholder string
# `<confidence level="HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW">` in scripts/ralph/prompt.md does
# not collide with a real emission and leak into the routing decision.
